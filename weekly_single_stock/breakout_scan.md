## Support and Resistance Zone Breakout Strategy

**Overview**

This strategy focuses on identifying support and resistance zones using pivot points, consolidating nearby zones, and detecting potential breakout patterns. By leveraging historical price data, the strategy aims to provide insights into areas where price movements may accelerate, offering opportunities for trading entries.

Key Features

	•	Pivot Points Detection: Identify local pivot highs and lows in the historical data to form key support and resistance zones.
	•	Zone Consolidation: Consolidates nearby zones to form stronger support and resistance levels based on a configurable range.
	•	Breakout Detection: Analyzes candles that cross above or below consolidated zones with volume confirmation to detect potential breakouts or breakdowns.
	•	Interactive Visualizations: Plots candlestick charts, pivot points, and breakout markers using Plotly for an interactive experience.

Usage

	1.	Ensure you have yfinance to fetch historical stock data.
	2.	The script processes stock data to detect zones and identifies potential breakouts using specific criteria.
	3.	You can visualize the analysis results using interactive charts generated by Plotly.

Example Usage:

# Instantiate the strategy
analysis = StockAnalysis(data)

# Detect and visualize
analysis.mark_pivots()
analysis.detect_zones()  # Adjust threshold as needed
analysis.detect_breakouts()
analysis.plot_data()  # Visualize results

How it Works

	1.	Fetching Data: The strategy fetches weekly historical stock data using yfinance.
	2.	Pivot Detection: It determines pivots using a sliding window to identify local highs and lows.
	3.	Zone Creation: Pivot points are aggregated into support and resistance zones, which are consolidated to form larger zones.
	4.	Breakout Detection: Breakouts are identified based on price closing above resistance zones with volume exceeding a certain factor.
	5.	Visualization: Generates a candlestick plot with highlighted zones and detected breakouts.

Configuration

	•	Pivot Window Size: The number of periods before and after a candle to consider for pivot detection.
	•	Zone Threshold: Determines the price range for consolidating zones.
	•	Volume Factor: Multiplier for average volume to confirm breakouts.
