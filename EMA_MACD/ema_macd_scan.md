52-Week High Breakout Strategy with EMA and MACD Analysis

Overview

This strategy identifies stocks that have closed at or above their 52-week high and combines this breakout condition with key technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator to generate buy signals. This strategy is specifically applied to a list of NSE 500 stocks using daily stock data fetched from Yahoo Finance.

Key Features

	•	Stock Data Collection: Automatically fetches historical daily stock data for NSE 500 stocks using the Yahoo Finance API.
	•	52-Week High Detection: Compares the latest closing price of each stock to its highest closing price over the past 252 trading days (approximately one year).
	•	EMA and MACD Indicators:
	•	Computes 5-day, 8-day, 13-day, and 21-day EMAs to track short-term trends.
	•	Calculates MACD and signal lines to identify momentum changes.
	•	Buy Signal Criteria: A buy signal is generated if:
	•	The stock’s latest closing price equals its 52-week high.
	•	The latest closing price is above the 5 EMA, 8 EMA, 13 EMA, and 21 EMA.
	•	The MACD line is above the signal line.
	•	Data Visualization:
	•	Candlestick plots of stock prices.
	•	EMA overlays and volume charts.
	•	MACD plots with signal line overlays for in-depth analysis.

How It Works

	1.	Data Fetching: The code fetches daily historical stock data for NSE 500 stocks starting from a specified date.
	2.	52-Week High Calculation: For each stock, the code checks if the latest closing price matches or surpasses its highest closing price in the last 252 trading days.
	3.	Indicator Computation: Computes EMAs, MACD, and signal lines to determine the strength of the trend.
	4.	Buy Signal Generation: If the conditions for the buy signal are met (latest close equals 52-week high, closing price above EMAs, MACD crossover), the stock is added to a list of stocks with buy signals.
	5.	Visualization: Generates candlestick charts with EMA overlays, volume, and MACD plots to visually analyze each identified stock.
