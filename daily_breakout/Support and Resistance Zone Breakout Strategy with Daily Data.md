## Support and Resistance Zone Breakout Strategy with Daily Data

**Overview**

This strategy focuses on detecting support and resistance zones using daily stock data, specifically the NSE 500 stock data, and identifying potential breakout opportunities. The approach leverages pivot points, consolidation of zones, and volume-based breakouts to identify key trading opportunities in financial markets.

Key Features

	•	Data Sourcing: Uses historical daily stock data for specified symbols via Yahoo Finance.
	•	Pivot Point Detection: Identifies local pivot highs and lows in the historical data, forming key support and resistance zones.
	•	Zone Consolidation: Consolidates nearby zones to form more robust support and resistance levels based on configurable parameters.
	•	Breakout Detection: Analyzes price candles that cross above or below resistance and support zones, using volume confirmation to detect potential breakouts or breakdowns.
	•	Visualization: Plots candlestick data along with volume, pivot points, and breakout markers for visual analysis.

How It Works

	1.	Initialization:
	•	The data is fetched for a specified stock symbol using the Yahoo Finance API and preprocessed.
	2.	Pivot Marking:
	•	Detects pivot points within a configurable window and assigns them as potential key points.
	3.	Zone Detection:
	•	Consolidates detected pivot points into broader zones of support and resistance.
	4.	Breakout Detection:
	•	Identifies potential breakouts by checking for strong price movement across these zones with volume confirmation.
	5.	Plotting:
	•	Provides visual plots of stock prices, volume, support/resistance zones, pivot points, and breakout markers using Plotly.


**Example**

# Import and initialize data analysis
analysis = StockAnalysis(data)
analysis.mark_pivots()
analysis.detect_zones()
analysis.detect_breakouts()
analysis.plot_data()
